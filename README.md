## Task 1: HTML + CSS

### Description
In this task, we implemented a static webpage using **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal was to create a responsive layout and design components such as cards, forms, and animations. The task focused on modern layout techniques like **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**, as well as accessibility testing using **WCAG 2.1** guidelines.

### Key Features:
- **Card Component**: A flexible card design with rounded edges and action icons.
- **Form Implementation**: A responsive form layout using CSS Grid.
- **Animations**: Pure CSS transitions and animations for interactive elements.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Test report for WCAG 2.1 compliance.

## Task 2: Interactive HTML with TypeScript

### Description
This task involved building a **data explorer** application where users could upload a CSV file and explore its data. The application was implemented using **TypeScript** for DOM manipulation and state management. The task focused on sorting, filtering, and displaying data in an interactive table.

### Key Features:
- **File Upload**: Users can upload CSV files and view file details (name, size, number of rows).
- **Interactive Table**: Sortable columns with ascending/descending functionality.
- **Column Information**: Display details about the selected column, including data type and unique entries.
- **State Persistence**: Table state (active column, sort order) is saved across page reloads.

## Task 3: React & Backend Integration

### Description
In this task, we reimplemented the data explorer using **React** and integrated it with a **Node.js** backend. The backend was built using **Express.js** and **Multer** for file uploads. The application also included real-time updates using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.

### Key Features:
- **React Components**: The entire UI was implemented using React components.
- **File Storage**: CSV files are uploaded and stored on the backend.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The UI updates in real-time when files are uploaded or deleted.
- **Loading Indicators**: Loading indicators are shown while data is being fetched or processed.
